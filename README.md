# DSA Algomap Questions

Welcome to the **DSA Algomap Questions** repository! This project is a curated collection of solutions to common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The repository is structured to help learners and enthusiasts understand and solve DSA problems efficiently. 

---

## Repository Structure
The repository currently contains a folder named **Array_and_Strings**, which includes solutions to the following problems:

1. **Closest Number to Zero**
   - **File**: `Closest_Number_To_Zero.cpp`
   - **Description**: This solution identifies the number closest to zero in a given array, considering both positive and negative values.

2. **Merge Strings Alternately**
   - **File**: `Merge_Strings_Alternately.cpp`
   - **Description**: This program merges two input strings alternately, character by character, creating a new interleaved string.

3. **Additional Problems**
   - More files and solutions are being actively added to this folder, providing a growing resource for learners.
